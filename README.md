This repository demonstrates a common error in DApps: unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous functions. The `getBalance` function attempts to retrieve an Ethereum account balance.  However, it lacks error handling for cases where the provided address is invalid or the web3 connection fails. This can lead to silent failures, making debugging difficult. The solution demonstrates how to properly handle promise rejections using `.catch()` to provide informative error messages.
